# Ethereum Blockchain Projects

A comprehensive collection of my smart contract projects on the Ethereum blockchain, showcasing various functionalities from token standards to decentralized applications (dApps). Each project is self-contained in its own directory, complete with its Solidity code and a dedicated README file for detailed information.

# 📜 Project Descriptions

Here is an overview of each project included in this repository:-
</br>
</br>


# 🪙 Tokens

A foundational project exploring various token standards. This folder contains implementations of:

ERC-20: The most common token standard, used for fungible tokens.

ERC-721: The standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

ERC-1155: A multi-token standard that allows for both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract.
</br>
</br>


# 💰 Staking

A decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to stake a specific ERC-20 token and earn rewards over time. The project demonstrates:

1.) Secure token locking and unlocking.

2.) Reward calculation based on time and amount staked.

3.) Withdrawal of staked tokens and earned rewards.
</br>
</br>


# 🖼️ NFT MarketPlace

A fully functional NFT marketplace smart contract. This project includes core features such as:

> Listing and selling NFTs.

> Bidding on NFTs.

> Transfer of ownership upon purchase.

> Royalty distribution to creators.
</br>
</br>


# 🗳️ Governance Token

A smart contract for a governance token, enabling on-chain decentralized governance. Key features include:

> A token that grants voting power to its holders.

> A voting system for proposals.

> Time-weighted voting to prevent flash loan attacks.
</br>
</br>


# 🏦 ERC3643

An implementation of the ERC-3643 standard for Tokenized Assets. This project focuses on a permissioned token, ideal for regulated environments. It includes:

> Role-based access control for minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

> A built-in identity registry for KYC/AML compliance.

> Compliance with the Token Taxonomy Framework.
</br>
</br>


# 🏬 ERC1155 MarketPlace

A specialized marketplace for trading ERC-1155 multi-tokens. This contract allows users to:

> List both fungible and non-fungible tokens from an ERC-1155 contract.

> Buy/sell various types of assets with a single contract.

> Efficiently manage multiple token IDs and balances.
</br>
</br>


# 🎁 Airdrop

A smart contract for distributing tokens to multiple addresses at once. This project demonstrates:

> A secure and gas-efficient method for mass token distribution.

> Prevention of duplicate airdrops to the same address.

> Batch processing of addresses and token amounts.
</br>
</br>
